Oh sorry !

I am Xeilhac,

Forgive my ramblings,
I was trying to remember a formula

Really crucial.
The formula for the soup that my grandmother
prepared me when I was a child
to cure me of various ailments.
Honestly, this soup was ...
completely ineffective!
And so sickening!
But I never dared to say it ...

Sorry ? Are you an adventurer?
Seeking to help Princess Statia?
Oh, but you need it in this case
a remedy to heal enemy attacks.
No, don't run away!
Nothing to do with this horrible soup ...
You need a Mandrake filter.
It is, for once, a formidable remedy.
Exactly, two farmers from the village
cultivate the Mandrake.
Go talk to them, and come see me again.

Hello young man.
Welcome

For generations,
we are cultivating Mandrake here.
A lot of patience is needed,
and order in the plants.
Oh it's a little farm
it's true, nothing extravagant,
and I am no longer very young ...
It is sometimes difficult to dig well ...
But on the days when I struggle
the spirit of my ancestors comes to my aid.
The Mandrake takes time,
and regular care ...
It is a rare herb,
endowed with life-giving power ...

to fight against my rheumatism)
If you're interested, young man,
The village chief can tell you more
